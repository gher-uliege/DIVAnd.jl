The result will be saved in the netCDF file filename under the variable varname.\n\nInputs\n\nxi: tuple with n elements. Every element represents a coordinate of the final grid on which the observations are interpolated\nx: tuple with n elements. Every element represents a coordinate of the observations\nvalue: value of the observations\nlen: tuple with n elements. Every element represents the correlation length.  If fitcorrlen is false (default), the correlation length should be expressed in meters.  If fitcorrlen is true, then len can be the empty tuple () or a tuple containing  3 arrays of normalized correlation lengths which will be multiplied by the  horizontal and vertical correlation lengths.\nepsilon2: error variance of the observations (normalized by the error variance of the background field).\n\nepsilon2 can be a scalar (all observations have the same error variance and their errors are decorrelated), a vector (all observations can have a different error variance and their errors are decorrelated) or a matrix (all observations can have a different error variance and their errors can be correlated). If epsilon2 is a scalar, it is thus the inverse of the signal-to-noise ratio.\n\nfilename: the output netCDF filename.\nvarname: the name of the variable (used in the netCDF file).\n\nOptional input arguments:\n\nbathname: path to the netCDF bathymetry (default ../../DIVAnd-example-data/Global/Bathymetry/gebco_30sec_16.nc relative to this source file)\nbathisglobal: true (default) is the bathymetry is a global data set\nplotres: call-back routine for plotting ((timeindex,sel,fit,erri) -> nothing)\ntimeorigin: time origin (default DateTime(1900,1,1,0,0,0))\nmoddim: modulo for cyclic dimension (vector with n elements).    Zero is used for non-cyclic dimensions. Halo points should    not be included for cyclic dimensions. For example if the first dimension    is cyclic, then the grid point corresponding to mask[1,j] should be    between mask[end,1] (left neighbor) and mask[2,j] (right neighbor). The default is [0,0,0],\nzlevel: :surface (default) for surface analysis and :floor for analysis from the bottom floor.\nncvarattrib: dictionary of netCDF variable attributes.\nncglobalattrib: dictionary of netCDF global attributes.\ntransform: Anamorphosis transformation function (default: Anam.notransform()).\nfitcorrlen: true if the correlation length is determined from the observation (default false).    Note that the parameter len is interpreted differently when fitcorrlen is set to true.\nfithorzcorrlen: true if the horizontal correlation length is determined from the observation (default: the value of fitcorrlen)    Note that the parameter len is interpreted differently when fithorzcorrlen is set to true.\nfitvertcorrlen: true if the vertical correlation length is determined from the observation (default: the value of fitcorrlen)    Note that the parameter len is interpreted differently when fitvertcorrlen is set to true.\nfithorz_param: dictionary with additional optional parameters for fithorzlen, for example: Dict(:smoothz => 200., :searchz => 50.).\nfitvert_param: dictionary with additional optional parameters for fitvertlen.\ndistfun: function to compute the distance (default (xi,xj) -> DIVAnd.distance(xi[2],xi[1],xj[2],xj[1])).\nmask: if different from nothing, then this mask overrides land-sea mask based on the bathymetry\n\n(default nothing).\n\nbackground: if different from nothing, then this parameter allows one\n\nto load the background from a call-back function (default nothing). The call-back functions has the parameters (x,n,trans_value,trans) where x represent the position of the observations, n the time index, trans_value, the observations (possibly transformed) and trans the transformation function. The output of this function is the gridded background field and the observations minus the background field.\n\nbackground_epsilon2_factor: multiplication for epsilon2 when computing a  vertical profile as a background estimate (default: computed internally based on the amount of data). This parameter is not used  when the parameter background or background_lenz is provided.\nbackground_lenz: vertical correlation for background computation (default 20 m). This parameter is not used  when the parameter background is provided.\nbackground_len: deprecated option replaced by background_lenz.\nfilterbackground: number of iterations to filter the background profile (default 0, no filtering)\nmemtofit: keyword controlling how to cut the domain depending on the memory   remaining available for inversion. It is not the total memory (default 3). Use a large value (e.g. 100) to force the   usage for the more efficient direct solver if you are not limited by the amount of RAM memory.\nminfield: if the analysed field is below minfield, its value is replace by minfield (default -Inf, i.e. no substitution is done).\nmaxfield: if the analysed field is above maxfield, its value is replace by maxfield (default +Inf, i.e. no substitution is done).\nsaveindex: controls if just a subset of the analysis should be saved to   the netCDF file. Per default, saveindex is (:,:,:) (corresponding to   longitude, latitude and depth indices) meaning that everything is saved.   If however, for example the first layer should not be saved then saveindex   should be (:,:,2:length(depthr)) where depthr is the 3rd element of xi.\nniter_e: Number of iterations to estimate the optimal scale factor of  epsilon2 using Desroziers et al. 2005 (doi: 10.1256/qj.05.108). The default   is 1 (i.e. no optimization is done).\ncoeff_derivative2 (vector of 3 floats): for every dimension where this value is non-zero, an additional term is added to the cost function penalizing the second derivative. A typical value of this parameter is [0.,0.,1e-8].\nsurfextend: create an additional layer on top of the surface layer so that the effective background error variance is more similar to the deep ocean.  false is the default value.\nstat_per_timeslice (default false): if true, then the residual values (and possibly qcvalues) are also returned by time slices which is useful if the time slices overlap (see example below).\nerror_thresholds (default [(\"L1\", 0.3), (\"L2\", 0.5)]). This is a list of tuples with the applied error thresholds and the variable names suffixes. If the variable is named e. g. \"Salinity\", then the variables \"Salinity_L1\" (resp.  \"Salinity_L2\") will be created where the analysis is masked if the relative error exceeds 0.3 (resp. 0.5).\ndivamethod: DIVAndgo (default) or DIVAndrun\n\nAny additional keywoard arguments understood by DIVAndgo/DIVAndrun can also be used here (e.g. velocity constrain)\n\nThe output is a dictionary with the followings keys:\n\n:residuals: the difference between the observations and the analysis (interpolated linearly to the\n\nlocation of the observations). The residual is NaN if the observations are not within the domain as defined by the mask and the coordinates of the observations x.\n\n:qcvalues: quality control scores (if activated)\n\nExample\n\nExample on how to aggredate the residuals per time slice and to retain the maximum residual:\n\nselection_per_timeslice = dbinfo[:selection_per_timeslice]\nresiduals_per_timeslice = dbinfo[:residuals_per_timeslice]\nselection_per_timeslice = dbinfo[:selection_per_timeslice]\n\nmax_residuals = fill(-Inf,length(value))\nfor n = 1:length(selection_per_timeslice)\n   sel = selection_per_timeslice[n]\n   max_residuals[sel] = max.(max_residuals[sel],residuals_per_timeslice[n])\nend\n\nnote: Note\nAt all vertical levels, there should at least one sea point.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#DIVAnd.DIVAndrun","page":"DIVAnd.jl documentation","title":"DIVAnd.DIVAndrun","text":"DIVAndrun(mask,pmn,xi,x,f,len,epsilon2; <keyword arguments>)\n\nPerform an n-dimensional variational analysis of the observations f located at the coordinates x. The array fi represent the interpolated field at the grid defined by the coordinates xi and the scales factors pmn.\n\nInput:\n\nmask: binary mask delimiting the domain. true is inside and false outside.\n\nFor oceanographic application, this is the land-sea mask where sea is true and land is false.\n\npmn: scale factor of the grid. pmn is a tuple with n elements. Every  element represents the scale factor of the corresponding dimension. Its  inverse is the local resolution of the grid in a particular dimension.  For example, in two dimensions, pmn is a tuple (pm,pn) where pm is  the inverse of the local resolution in first dimension and pn is the the inverse  of the local resolution in second dimension.\nxi: tuple with n elements. Every element represents a coordinate of the final grid on which the observations are interpolated.\nx: tuple with n elements. Every element represents a coordinate of the observations.\nf: value of the observations minus the background estimate (vector of m elements where m is the number of observations). See also note.\nlen: tuple with n elements. Every element represents the correlation length for a given dimension.\nepsilon2: error variance of the observations (normalized by the error variance of the background field). epsilon2 can be a scalar (all observations have the same error variance and their errors are decorrelated), a vector (all observations can have a different error variance and their errors are decorrelated) or a matrix (all observations can have a different error variance and their errors can be correlated). If epsilon2 is a scalar, it is thus the inverse of the signal-to-noise ratio.\n\nOptional input arguments specified as keyword arguments\n\nvelocity: velocity of the advection constraint. It is a tuple of n arrays and each array represents a single velocity component. The individual array should have the same size as the final grid. The first (second,..) element of the velocity is the velocity compomenent along the first (second,...) dimension. The velocity has the units of a length-scale. If this parameter is derived from ocean currents, then the later must be multiplied by a factor (to be determined for example by cross-validation) and this factor has the units of a time-scale. The default is no-advection constraint.\nalpha: alpha is vector of coefficients multiplying various terms in the      cost function. The first element multiplies the norm.      The other i-th element of alpha multiplies the (i+1)-th derivative.      Per default, the highest derivative is m = ceil(1+neff/2) where neff is the      effective dimension of the problem (the number of dimensions with a nonzero      correlation length) and ceil is the ceiling function (rounding up).\n\n   The values of alpha is the (m+1)th row of the Pascal triangle:\n      m=0         1\n      m=1       1   1\n      m=1     1   2   1     (n=1,2)\n      m=2   1   3   3   1   (n=3,4)\n      ...\n\nconstraints: a structure with user specified constraints (see DIVAnd_addc).\nmoddim: modulo for cyclic dimension (vector with n elements).    Zero is used for non-cyclic dimensions. One should not include a boundary    zone (sometimes called a ghost zone or halo) for cyclic dimensions.    For example if the first dimension    is cyclic, then the grid point corresponding to mask[1,j] should be    between mask[end,j] (left neighbor) and mask[2,j] (right neighbor).\nfracindex: fractional indices (n-by-m array). If this array is specified,    then x and xi are not used.\ninversion: direct solver (:chol for Cholesky factorization), an    interative solver (:pcg for preconditioned conjugate gradient [1]) can be    used or :cgamgsa for a multigrid method with preconditioned conjugate     gradient. The two last methods are iterative methods who a controlled by     the number of iterations maxit and the tolerance tol.\ncompPC: function that returns a preconditioner for the primal formulation    if inversion is set to 'pcg'. :The function has the following arguments:\n     fun = compPC(iB,H,R)\nwhere iB is the inverse background error covariance, H the observation   operator and R the error covariance of the observation. The function compPC returns the   preconditioner fun(x,fx) computing fx = M \\ x (the inverse of M times x)   where M is a positive defined symmetric matrix [1].   Effectively, the system E⁻¹ A (E⁻¹)ᵀ (E x) = E⁻¹ b is solved for (E x) where E Eᵀ = M.   Ideally, M should this be similar to A, so that E⁻¹ A (E⁻¹)ᵀ is close to the identity matrix.\nfi0: starting field for iterative primal algorithm (same size as mask).\nf0: starting field for iterative dual algorithm (same size as the observations f).\noperatortype: Val{:sparse} for using sparse matrices (default) or Val{:MatFun} or using functions   to define the constrains.\nscale_len: true (default) if the correlation length-scale should be scaled   such that the analytical   kernel reaches 0.6019072301972346 (besselk(1.,1.)) at the same distance   than in 2D. The kernel behaves thus similar to   the default kernel in two dimensions (alpha = [1,2,1]).\nalphabc: numerical value defining how the last grid points are stretched outward.  If alphabc is 1, the default value mimics an infinite domain.  To have previous behaviour of finite domain use alphabc equal to 0.\nbtrunc: if provided defines where to truncate the calculation of the   covariance matrix B. Only values up and including alpha[btrunc] will be   calculated. If the iterative solution is calculated, the missing terms will   be calculated on the fly during the conjugate gradient calculations.    Default value is none and full covariance calculation.\n\nOutput:\n\nfi: the analysed field\ns: a structure with an array s.P representing the analysed error covariance\n\nNote:\n\nIf zero is not a valid first guess for your variable (as it is the case for   e.g. ocean temperature), you have to subtract the first guess from the   observations before calling DIVAnd and then add the first guess back in.\n\nExample:\n\nsee DIVAndsimpleexample.jl\n\nReferences\n\n[1]  https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conjugategradientmethod&oldid=761287292#Thepreconditionedconjugategradientmethod\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#DIVAnd.DIVAndgo","page":"DIVAnd.jl documentation","title":"DIVAnd.DIVAndgo","text":"fi, erri, residuals, qcvalues, scalefactore = DIVAndgo(mask,pmn,xi,x,f,len,epsilon2,errormethod; ...);\n\nInput:\n\nSame arguments as DIVAndrun with in addition\nerrormethod :   you have the choice between :cpme (clever poorman's method, default method if parameter not provided), :none or :exact (only available if windowed analysis are done with DIVAndrun)\nMEMTOFIT=: keyword controlling how to cut the domain depending on the memory remaining available for inversion (not total memory)\nRTIMESONESCALES= : if you provide a tuple of length scales, data are weighted differently depending on the numbers of neighbours they have.
